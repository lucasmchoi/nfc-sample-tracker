    User->>PiPico: Approach with User NFC Tag (optional)
    alt User NFC Tag present
        PiPico->>UserNFC: Read User NFC Tag
        UserNFC-->>PiPico: Return hashed user_id
        PiPico->>FastAPI: POST /api/users/verify (hashed user_id)
        FastAPI->>MongoDB: Verify user
        MongoDB-->>FastAPI: Confirm user verified
        FastAPI-->>PiPico: User verified
    else User NFC Tag not present or read fails
        PiPico->>PiPico: Note user not identified
    end

    User->>PiPico: Approach with Sample Case
    PiPico->>SampleNFC: Read Sample Case NFC Tag
    SampleNFC-->>PiPico: Return sample ObjectId and number

    PiPico->>PiPico: Get current timestamp
    PiPico->>PiPico: Get hardcoded location

    alt User was verified
        PiPico->>FastAPI: POST /api/samples/add-location (sample ObjectId, location, timestamp, user_id)
    else User was not verified
        PiPico->>FastAPI: POST /api/samples/add-location (sample ObjectId, location, timestamp)
    end

    FastAPI->>MongoDB: Add new location entry to sample document
    MongoDB-->>FastAPI: Confirm location added

    alt Location added successfully
        FastAPI->>MongoDB: Query for sample owner's email
        MongoDB-->>FastAPI: Return owner's email
        alt User was not verified
            FastAPI->>EmailService: Send notification email to sample owner about unverified location update
        else User was verified
            FastAPI->>EmailService: Send notification email to sample owner about verified location update
        end
        EmailService-->>FastAPI: Confirm email sent
        FastAPI-->>PiPico: Confirm successful location update
        PiPico->>PiPico: Light success LED

        FastAPI-->>PiPico: Return error
        PiPico->>PiPico: Light error LED
    end

    Note over User, EmailService: New location is added to the sample's history,<br>and owner is notified of the update
